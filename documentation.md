## Usage

[The Red Hat Customer Portal product documentation pages](https://access.redhat.com/pilot-documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8) document how to use the "web console" (another name for Cockpit). While this is specifically for the version of Cockpit that ships in Red Hat Enterprise Linux, the interface and its usage is similar on other distributions where the Cockpit web console exists.
