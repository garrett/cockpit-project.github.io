Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/).
We release regularly.

Here are the release notes from Cockpit 273 and cockpit-machines 272:


## cockpit/ws container: Support modern SSH keys

[Cockpit 272](https://cockpit-project.org/blog/cockpit-272.html) introduced [cockpit/ws container](https://quay.io/repository/cockpit/ws) support for authenticating with classic RSA PEM type SSH keys. This was improved to support all key types, in particular the "OpenSSH" format or EC types.

## Software Updates: Optionally reboot after updating

The update progress page offers you to reboot the machine after applying updates succeeded. If the machine can be rebooted without careful planning, this avoids having to wait and do another interactive step.

## Networking: Suggest netmask and gateway addresses

When adding a manual IPv4 address to a network interface, the dialog now proposes plausible values for the net mask (based on the network class) and gateway (usually ending with .1 or .254):

_Thanks to Gil Obradors for contributing this feature!_

## Metrics: Display CPU temperature

The metrics details page now shows the CPU temperature, including a warning icon when it becomes too hot.

## Machines: Download RHEL images

You can now create Red Hat Enterprise Linux VMs. The dialog guides you to the page where you can get a download token for your Red Hat subscription, and uses that to download the VM image.
