Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/).
We release regularly.

Here are the release notes from Cockpit 285:


## Accounts: Group improvements

Users can now create a new group. Existing groups can be filtered by name or GID.

## Support a subset of cryptographic policies with subpolicies

Cockpit now supports setting a limited set of cryptographic policies with subpolicies depending on the RHEL/Fedora version. Subpolicies extend a normal cryptographic policy by for example allowing SHA1 or setting stricter requirements such as OSPP.
