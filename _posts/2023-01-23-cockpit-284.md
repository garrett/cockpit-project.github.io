Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/).
We release regularly.

Here are the release notes from Cockpit 284 and cockpit-machines 282:


## Accounts: Group improvements

State: **OPEN** (will not be included) @ <https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/pull/18136>
{:.warn}

Users can now create a new group or rename an existing one. Existing groups can be filtered by name or GID.

Groups have a details page, where accounts can be added and removed.

Searching has been added to groups.

## Services: Create timer to run every minute

State: **merged** @ <https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/pull/18072>
{:.note}

In the Timers part of Services page, the create timer dialog can create systemd timers to run in "minutely" mode, which runs a command every minute on the specified second.

## Services: Show logs for user units

State: **merged** @ <https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/pull/18032>
{:.note}

The Services page now shows journal logs for user systemd services.

---------------------------
Removes the limitation mentioned in https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/commit/154da47d947eb39ebf2bed4cf6e1ecfc1623a25e:
> * Hide service logs for user services. These are available but the
LogsPanel component will need some extension for supporting it.

## Support for custom time servers with chronyd

State: **OPEN** (will not be included) @ <https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/pull/17992>
{:.warn}

Cockpit had support for adding custom NTP time servers for some time already, but only if your OS was using systemd-timesyncd, such as Debian and Ubuntu. Now you can also add custom time servers on operating systems that use chronyd by default, such as Fedora, CentOS, and RHEL.

## Storage: The "nofail" and "_netdev" options are exposed as a dropdown

State: **OPEN** (will not be included) @ <https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/pull/17888>
{:.warn}

New filesystems now default to "nofail", so that they wont prevent you from fixing things up with Cockpit again when they fail to mount on the next boot.

## Storage: Support for fixing a system to support NBDE

State: **merged** @ <https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/pull/17796>
{:.note}

It is possible (and unfortunately liklely) that a system is misconfigured and can not mount filesystems during boot that rely on Clevis to unlock them. Cockpit can now fix this when adding a keyserver to a encrypted filesystem.

## Machines: Option to forcefully revert a snapshot

State: **merged** @ <https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit-machines/pull/917>
{:.note}

There are situations where a snapshot revert involves extra risk and the user should either consider not reverting snapshot, or force it. The few most common cases are:
- Snapshot that lacks full domain information for reverting configuration. In this case, the user should be sure that snapshot is compatible with the current configuration (if it is not, the domain will likely fail to run).
- Reverting from a running domain to an active state where a new hypervisor has to be created rather than reusing the existing hypervisor.
- Snapshot of inactive VM which also has a managed saved state. This requires forceful revert because the snapshot does not contain a memory state and will therefore not replace the existing memory state. This ends up switching a disk underneath a running system and can cause filesystem corruption or crashes due to swap content mismatches when run.

## If storage file fails to get deleted, the disk will still get detached from the VM, but we show a warning:
