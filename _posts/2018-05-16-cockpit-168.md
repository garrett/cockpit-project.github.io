Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/). We release regularly.
Here are the release notes from version 168.

### Improve checks for root privilege availability

Many actions, like rebooting the machine or joining an IPA domain, can only be
done by an administrator (`root`). To decide whether to enable these actions,
Cockpit previously checked if the user was a member of the `wheel`
(RHEL/Fedora) or `sudo` (Debian) groups.

This was insufficient: Other operating systems or local customizations might
use other groups, or have user instead of group based sudo rules. For example
with FreeIPA central user management, sudo access is given through the
`admins@domain.name` group.

Cockpit now does not make any assumptions about special groups any more, and
instead just checks if the user is capable of running commands as `root`. Most
notably this makes privileged operations work out of the box with FreeIPA.
