Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/).
We release regularly.

Here are the release notes from Cockpit 274 and cockpit-podman 52:


## Shell: Support for alternatives to sudo

State: **OPEN** (will not be included) @ <https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/pull/17536>
{:.warn}

Cockpit always had the ability to run arbitrary programs to gain administrative access, by adding them to a package manifest.  However, the UI would always use "sudo". Now the UI lets you select which program to use when multiple are defined in the manifests.

By default, Cockpit will still only use "sudo", so unless you actually add more programs via a manifest, there will be no visible change in the UI.


## Display ports, volumes and environment variables

State: **merged** @ <https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit-podman/pull/1017>
{:.note}

Published ports, mounted volumes and environment variables are now visible in container integration tab.
By default only variables set by user are shown and after clicking `Show more` all variables are visible.
