Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/).
We release regularly.

Here are the release notes from Cockpit 283 and cockpit-machines 281:


## Accounts: introduced more operations fir groups

State: **OPEN** (will not be included) @ <https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/pull/18136>
{:.warn}

Users can now create a new group or rename an existing one. Existing groups can be filtered by name or gid.

## Create timer minutely option

State: **merged** @ <https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/pull/18072>
{:.note}

The create timer dialog now allows to specify a minutely interval for systemd timers.

## Services: show logs for user systemd services

State: **OPEN** (will not be included) @ <https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/pull/18032>
{:.warn}

---------------------------
Removes the limitation mentioned in https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/commit/154da47d947eb39ebf2bed4cf6e1ecfc1623a25e:
> * Hide service logs for user services. These are available but the
LogsPanel component will need some extension for supporting it.

## Support for custom time servers with chronyd

State: **OPEN** (will not be included) @ <https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/pull/17992>
{:.warn}

Cockpit had support for adding custom NTP time servers for some time already, but only if your OS was using systemd-timesyncd, such as Debian and Ubuntu. Now you can also add custom time servers on operating systems that use chronyd by default, such as Fedora, CentOS, and RHEL.

## Storage: The "nofail" and "_netdev" options are exposed as a dropdown

State: **OPEN** (will not be included) @ <https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/pull/17888>
{:.warn}

New filesystems now default to "nofail", so that they wont prevent you from fixing things up with Cockpit again when they fail to mount on the next boot.

## Accounts: Redesign and include groups

State: **merged** @ <https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/pull/17830>
{:.note}

The Accounts page has been redesigned. Groups are listed at the top of the page and the list of users is enhanced with details and filtering. Additionally, a user's groups can be edited while viewing details for the user.

## Storage: Support for fixing a system to support NBDE

State: **OPEN** (will not be included) @ <https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/pull/17796>
{:.warn}

It is possible (and unfortunately liklely) that a system is misconfigured and can not mount filesystems during boot that rely on Clevis to unlock them. Cockpit can now fix this when adding a keyserver to a encrypted filesystem.

## Right-to-left language support

State: **merged** @ <https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit/pull/14107>
{:.note}

Right-to-left language support has been enabled for languages that require it. Our most complete RTL language is Hebrew. When choosing Hebrew in the languages list, the layout will shift and become right-aligned.

In addition to basic RTL support, we have started to modify Cockpit and PatternFly to work with RTL languages in a better way. This is not complete, but we wanted to enable this as soon as possible, so people could use it and report bugs.

We are aware that there are some basic issues across Cockpit. Most of Cockpit should be usable in RTL, but there are still some alignment and spacing problems.

The most affected pages at the moment are:
- the login page (which does not currently adapt to RTL)
- optional pages such as `cockpit-podman`, `cockpit-machines`, and `cockpit-ostree`
- all 3rd party app pages

If you know Hebrew, then please help us with the implementation. If you know other RTL languages, we're happy to work with you to help improve translations.

We will try to further improve RTL to the best of our ability, but need help from people who actually know Hebrew to make sure it is correct.

## Clarify the difference between user and system connection

State: **merged** @ <https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit-machines/pull/875>
{:.note}

**System:**
- Ideal for server VMs
- VM will launch with root permissions
- Ideal networking support
- Permissions denied for disk images in home directories

**User session:**
- Good choice for desktop virtualization
- VM launched with unprivileged limited access, with the process and PTY owned by your user account
- Restrictions in networking (SLIRP-based emulation) and PCI device assignment
- Disk images can be stored in user home directory

## Machines: added configuration for watchdog device

State: **merged** @ <https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit-machines/pull/860>
{:.note}

![screenshot of added configuration for watchdog device]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/283-machines-added-configuration-for-watchdog-device.png)


### Things to do after this is merged:

 * [ ] Create a libvirt issue requiring all watchdog actions to have relevant VM events (it seems that currently only watchdog reset and watchdog force-off have events)
 * [ ] Create a libvirt issue asking for API to check VM's history of watchdog events (this would allow us to see if VM is stuck in a reboot loop)
 * [ ] Create an issue to implement a warning if VM is crashed
 * [ ] Redesign VM's Overview tab since it's getting crowded

## If storage file fails to get deleted, the disk will still get detached from the VM, but we show a warning:
