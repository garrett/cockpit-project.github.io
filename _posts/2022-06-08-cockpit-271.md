Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](https://cockpit-project.org/).
We release regularly.

Here are the release notes from Cockpit 271:


## Show container names on the Metrics page

Instead of just showing a container ID, Cockpit now displays Podman container names in the CPU and Memory usage cards on the "Metrics and history" page.

Additionally, after clicking a container name on the Metrics page, you'll see just the container you clicked on within Cockpit-Podman, thanks to improved filtering.
