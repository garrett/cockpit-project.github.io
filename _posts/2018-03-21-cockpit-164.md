Cockpit is the [modern Linux admin interface](http://cockpit-project.org/). We release regularly.
Here are the release notes from version 164.

### Storage: Usability improvements

As a result from a usability test study, applying actions to NFS, VDO, and
RAID storage devices got reorganized. The check box "arming" and drop-down
buttons that would previously reveal the available actions were too hard and
unintuitive to discover.

The available RAID and VDO actions are now directly shown next to the
corresponding device:

NFS mounts are now clickable:

![Storage NFS list](/images/storage-nfs-list.png)

This leads to a new details page about that mount, which again directly
presents the available actions:

### System: Show available package updates and missing registration

The front (System) page now shows if there are pending enhancement, bug fix, or
security updates available:

![System available security updates](/images/system-security-updates.png)

On RHEL systems it now also shows a warning if the system is not properly
registered and thus cannot receive updates:

### System: Fix inconsistent tooltips

Previously the front (System) page had three different styles of tool tips.
They have been unified to use the standard
[Bootstrap tooltips](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/tooltips/)
which are being used on other Cockpit pages. Also, the static blue "i"
indicator got removed from the performance profile, the tooltip is now
attached directly to the profile name:

Since the navigation redesign in [Cockpit 156](https://martinpitt.github.io/cockpit-project.github.io/blog/cockpit-156.html)
the tool tips on the navigation menu provide no extra information any more, so
they got removed.

### Logs: Change severities

The severity filter on the Logs page now exposes the officially defined
[syslog(3) levels](https://linux.die.net/man/3/syslog) instead of the previous
Cockpit-specific names:

Thanks to Kirill Glebov for this improvement!

### Machines: Add error notifications

The Machines page now shows individual and dismissable error notifications for
all virtual machines:

Thanks to suomiy for this  improvement!

### Accessibility improvements

The navigation menu and several pages now have
[ARIA markers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA), role tags, tab index fixes, and
other changes make Cockpit pages more accessibile.

### Reloading the page in the browser now reloads Cockpit package manifests

Previously it required logging out and back in to update the navigation menu
after installing/removing/updating Cockpit packages.
